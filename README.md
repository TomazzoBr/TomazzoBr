- 👋 Hi, I’m @TomazzoBr

  ## About me
  
  Brazilian currently based in sunny Barcelona, passionate about the world and its amazing diversity of culture. I'm always learning something new, at the moment I'm starting to learn to surf, italian and react-native, with which I'm developing a personal project. Decided to learn programming so I could give life to my ideas.

- 👀 I’m interested in participating in big and exciting projects!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React-native
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on activities that aim to improve life quality, equality and sustainability.
